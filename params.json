{"name":"ProjectBIOS","body":"# Welcome to Jacob Deines's Capstone Blog\r\nThis website will be my attempt to track our progress throughout the process of building and designing a BIOS system for the Raspberry Pi. Our team consists of three members, Josh Nelson, Dan Case, and myself. This is a student project at PLU for our capstone class. Our faculty mentor is Dr. Kakar. Our project website can be found at [biosproject.github.com/biosRepo/](http://biosproject.github.com/biosRepo/).\r\n## Our Plan\r\nOur plan is to design and implement a Basic Input Output System (BIOS) tailor-made for the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi uses an ARM processor, so we are still working on if our plan can be implemented as is. If not, we may have to switch to another small system. We are still in the preliminary stages of our research and conceivably will not know for certain if it can be done until we attempt it. For now, we are gung-ho and are excited to try something new and different!\r\n## Benefits\r\nThe potential benefits of this project are many. The first of which is that is is different from the typical project at PLU. Many projects are solely based in high-level coding and design, whereas our project aims to reach through to the lowest levels of abstraction. This experience with low-level coding is a major advantage in the workplace, because it helps us understand and interpret what goes on at a higher level. This understanding gives us an edge when running into problems of design or implementation. We will better understand how software and hardware communicate, potentially revealing previously unseen ways to better our code.\r\n## Timeline\r\nOur time line is obviously tentative, as is the hallmark of software development. However, we plan on meeting the following dates with these goals in mind:\r\n* September: We have been hard at work conducting research and planning\r\n* October:   We plan on having our requirements document finalized\r\n* November:  Our plan is to have completed at least preliminary function testing on the Raspberry Pi\r\n* December:  Our project plan should be finished and we should be starting implementation\r\n* January:   We hope to have implemented our BIOS POST (Power On Self-Test)\r\n* February:  Implement hardware configuration\r\n* March:     Nail down boot-strapping\r\n* April:     Complete development and testing of our BIOS\r\n* May:       Present our project\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Blog\r\n## 10/4/2012\r\nOur group has set up regular meeting times, and we have our meetings with Prof. Kakar planned out. We are still working on our requirements document, and have hashed out a lot of potential problems with our project. We are still gathering resources at this point, but we are getting some literature going, as well as web articles. Since Raspberry Pi as a company is focused on education, we plan on attempting to make contact with them and see if we can correspond with someone, either short term or (preferably) long term.\r\nAs a team, I think we are working well. We just recently got our schedules together to coordinate meeting times more efficiently, and encountered an age-old problem: It's hard to meet up when we all have different schedules. Currently, I have the hardest time fitting things in to our meeting times. As a result, I feel as if I am not doing my share of work, but am still focused on email correspondence and meeting up whenever possible. After mid-semester break, I will have much more free time, and our group should hopefully be able to meet more easily.\r\nBoth Dan and Josh are working diligently. Josh lives pretty far away from school, so it's also hard meeting with him, but he is doing a great amount of research for us and has found some really helpful sources. Given his previous experience with lower-level programming, he is finding things I personally hadn't even considered looking for. Dan is also working hard; he and I meet up fairly regularly because we share another course. Dan's knowledge of circuits has come in handy in looking up the hardware configurations for the Raspberry Pi, and we've been able to make some pretty surprising discoveries because of it. Cheers!\r\n## 9/25/2012\r\nThis is my first blog post! Not much to report, but we are starting some good preliminary research and are making some headway toward our requirements document. So far scheduling times for all three of us to meet has been difficult, but doable. Cheers!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
