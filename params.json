Our team consists of three members, Josh Nelson, Dan Case, and myself. This is a student project at PLU for our capstone class. Our faculty mentor is Dr. Kakar. Our project website can be found at [biosproject.github.com/biosRepo/](http://biosproject.github.com/biosRepo/).\r\n## Our Plan\r\nOur plan is to design and implement a Basic Input Output System (BIOS) tailor-made for the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi uses an ARM processor, so we are still working on if our plan can be implemented as is. If not, we may have to switch to another small system. We are still in the preliminary stages of our research and conceivably will not know for certain if it can be done until we attempt it. For now, we are gung-ho and are excited to try something new and different!\r\n## Benefits\r\nThe potential benefits of this project are many. The first of which is that is is different from the typical project at PLU. Many projects are solely based in high-level coding and design, whereas our project aims to reach through to the lowest levels of abstraction. This experience with low-level coding is a major advantage in the workplace, because it helps us understand and interpret what goes on at a higher level. This understanding gives us an edge when running into problems of design or implementation. We will better understand how software and hardware communicate, potentially revealing previously unseen ways to better our code.\r\n## Timeline\r\nOur time line is obviously tentative, as is the hallmark of software development. However, we plan on meeting the following dates with these goals in mind:\r\n* September: We have been hard at work conducting research and planning\r\n* October:   We plan on having our requirements document finalized\r\n* November:  Our plan is to have completed at least preliminary function testing on the Raspberry Pi\r\n* December:  Our project plan should be finished and we should be starting implementation\r\n* January:   We hope to have implemented our BIOS POST (Power On Self-Test)\r\n* February:  Implement hardware configuration\r\n* March:     Nail down boot-strapping\r\n* April:     Complete development and testing of our BIOS\r\n* May:       Present our project\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Blog\r\n## 10/12/2012\r\nWe now have a book from Dr. Crocker (thanks to Dan for that) about the ARM 11 architecture, which has some good stuff in it. Currently, we are still reviewing it, so there's not a lot of knowledge to throw down just yet. We also got more set up in our workroom. Meeting with Dr. Kakar on Wednesday was definitely valuable. He suggested that we meet up with Dylan Mark, who graduated last year and could be of some help, and John Schock, a BIOS engineer at Intel and alumnus of PLU. Josh has started posting on the Rapberry Pi forums, looking for advice, and I am trying to track down an email for Mr. Schock that is not linked with his LinkedIn account, considering I don't know how reliable that is to contact him. If by Saturday I can't find one, I'll shoot him a message over LinkedIn and see if he can be of help. We are also still planning on contacting Raspberry Pi directly and seeing if we can talk to someone there. Some issues we haven't worked out yet, there's no CMOS (I'm pretty sure it's CMOS) on the Pi itself, which means that the hardware must somehow already be configured to look at the SD card for all the necessary boot information before the BIOS loads up. We are currently looking into how that works.\r\n\r\nJosh and Dan are both working hard, and with Dr. Kakar's help, I think we have a legitimate chance of pulling this off. After next week my schedule will open up considerably, and we will have a good amount of time in the mornings to work on capstone in our workroom. On Saturday, Dan and I are meeting up on Saturday and Josh will telecommute via Skype, so we can work more on our Requirements Doc. I plan on reading as much as I can about the ARM 11 until then (and during) and researching as much as I can about the exact process a computer goes through during BIOS. Our plan is to get a rough draft to Dr. Kakar by Thursday for him to look over, then revise, revise, revise until we have to turn it in. Cheers!\r\n## 10/4/2012\r\nOur group has set up regular meeting times, and we have our meetings with Prof. Kakar planned out. We are still working on our requirements document, and have hashed out a lot of potential problems with our project. We are still gathering resources at this point, but we are getting some literature going, as well as web articles. Since Raspberry Pi as a company is focused on education, we plan on attempting to make contact with them and see if we can correspond with someone, either short term or (preferably) long term.\r\n\r\nAs a team, I think we are working well. We just recently got our schedules together to coordinate meeting times more efficiently, and encountered an age-old problem: It's hard to meet up when we all have different schedules. Currently, I have the hardest time fitting things in to our meeting times. As a result, I feel as if I am not doing my share of work, but am still focused on email correspondence and meeting up whenever possible. After mid-semester break, I will have much more free time, and our group should hopefully be able to meet more easily.\r\n\r\nBoth Dan and Josh are working diligently. Josh lives pretty far away from school, so it's also hard meeting with him, but he is doing a great amount of research for us and has found some really helpful sources. Given his previous experience with lower-level programming, he is finding things I personally hadn't even considered looking for. Dan is also working hard; he and I meet up fairly regularly because we share another course. Dan's knowledge of circuits has come in handy in looking up the hardware configurations for the Raspberry Pi, and we've been able to make some pretty surprising discoveries because of it. Cheers!\r\n## 9/25/2012\r\nThis is my first blog post! Not much to report, but we are starting some good preliminary research and are making some headway toward our requirements document. So far scheduling times for all three of us to meet has been difficult, but doable. Cheers!","tagline":"Three students' attempt to design and implement a BIOS for the Raspberry Pi","google":""}
