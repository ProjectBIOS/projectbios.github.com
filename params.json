Our team consists of three members, Josh Nelson, Dan Case, and myself. This is a student project at PLU for our capstone class. Our faculty mentor is Dr. Kakar. Our project website can be found at [biosproject.github.com/biosRepo/](http://biosproject.github.com/biosRepo/).\r\n## Our Plan\r\nOur plan is to design and implement a Basic Input Output System (BIOS) tailor-made for the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi uses an ARM processor, so we are still working on if our plan can be implemented as is. If not, we may have to switch to another small system. We are still in the preliminary stages of our research and conceivably will not know for certain if it can be done until we attempt it. For now, we are gung-ho and are excited to try something new and different!\r\n## Benefits\r\nThe potential benefits of this project are many. The first of which is that is is different from the typical project at PLU. Many projects are solely based in high-level coding and design, whereas our project aims to reach through to the lowest levels of abstraction. This experience with low-level coding is a major advantage in the workplace, because it helps us understand and interpret what goes on at a higher level. This understanding gives us an edge when running into problems of design or implementation. We will better understand how software and hardware communicate, potentially revealing previously unseen ways to better our code.\r\n## Timeline\r\nOur time line is obviously tentative, as is the hallmark of software development. However, we plan on meeting the following dates with these goals in mind:\r\n* September: We have been hard at work conducting research and planning\r\n* October:   We plan on having our requirements document finalized\r\n* November:  Our plan is to have completed at least preliminary function testing on the Raspberry Pi\r\n* December:  Our project plan should be finished and we should be starting implementation\r\n* January:   We hope to have implemented our BIOS POST (Power On Self-Test)\r\n* February:  Implement hardware configuration\r\n* March:     Nail down boot-strapping\r\n* April:     Complete development and testing of our BIOS\r\n* May:       Present our project\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Blog\r\n## 11/4/2012\r\nThis week was fairly laid back. We got together a couple of times for research, and mostly found more issues that we need to solve, such as finding a compatible bootloader and how to build project files. We ordered a Raspberry Pi kit that includes the Pi, a case, charging cable and SD card. Buying the components individually would have ended up costing more. We are continuing to correspond with John Schock and Tosh has informed us that he will ask John to be a professional mentor, since has been so eager to help us out so far. We have started a research plan for our printed resources. One person takes home one book, reads as much relevant information as possible from it, takes notes, and then shares those notes with the group. That way we can get through several books much faster, and have a good idea of the information in each. All group members are working well together, and we intend to make the best of this long bit of unstructured time. Filling our time with research (especially when we have the Pi in hand) and prototyping will be very helpful.\r\n## 10/27/2012\r\nOn Wednesday I went to the library to research for more books. I ended up with five, most of which simply provide an overview of bootstrapping or an explanation of what a BIOS is. However, I found two books which could be of great use, as they have whole chapters on the boot process. All of the books I collected were coincidentally about the Linux kernel, which is actually more helpful than harmful considering the operating system we plan to boot to is going to be a Linux distribution. We finally got to correspond via email with John Schock, and we are finding out that we still have a lot to do. For debugging, we are still working out the kinks, but as we understand it, the ARM JTAG debugger works for our purposes, and we could also use VirtualBox on Linux machines so we have a virtual machine. Mr. Schock suggested that we turn our development more toward an EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) boot on top of the existing init code for the SoC chip. Otherwise, it would require a lot more work and some legal finagling to continue.\r\n\r\nMost of our week was spent working on the Requirements Document. I can say that by the end, we were all exhausted, frustrated, and much more thoroughly knowledgeable about our own project. I did have one complaint, which I expressed in rant form to Josh and Dan earlier in the week. I was frustrated because we were not getting our documents in to Tosh to review. The response I would get when I would suggest it, was that the document was unpolished enough to send to review. I explained that Tosh is a valuable resource and by cutting him out of our project (because our draft was still a draft) was subversively hurting us as a group. Now that we have all discussed it, however, I hope this will no longer be a problem.\r\n\r\nAs a team, I was surprised at the amount of accountability we had with each other, considering that the past couple weeks were much less structured. Every time we planned to meet up, we would text one another and make sure they were on their way. Josh helped out from home, which is great, and even stayed late on Thursday night, which can be a drag when having to drive so far. Dan's hectic work schedule got in the way a bit, but overall he was there when he was needed, and really helped pull together some of the major sections in our document. Overall, I think that we are on an upswing that will put us closer to the right track, and on time for completing our BIOS. Cheers!\r\n## 10/19/2012\r\nThis week has been mostly focused on creating our Requirements Document. We have mostly been working on it through the Google doc and not in person, however we did meet up with Tosh and determine where we think we are on the project and the Requirements doc. We are still looking for more resources, most of which are either too detailed, or focused mainly on things we don't need to look at. Josh and I found a good couple of sites that have open source BIOS projects, but most are either incomplete or are a sort of amalgam of different softwares and firmwares. I downloaded the repository from one of them, called Coreboot, which I hope will help when we look through their code. So far as I understand it, the Coreboot system works by performing the necessary hardware initialization (which is what we are mainly interested in right now), then loads \"payloads\" which appear to be different bootstrapping programs. According to their wiki, the Linux kernel can be loaded payload free, so that is probably what we want to look at more in depth.\r\n\r\nOur group is doing well, and now that I have no more PE classes, I have more time to work on things. Josh and Dan are both doing well and it appears they are making headway on their contacts. I have personally contacted Dillon Mark and asked him to see if he could forward us John Schock's information so we could get a hold of him. I am hopeful that we actually get to directly correspond with Mr. Schock soon.\r\n## 10/12/2012\r\nWe now have a book from Dr. Crocker (thanks to Dan for that) about the ARM 11 architecture, which has some good stuff in it. Currently, we are still reviewing it, so there's not a lot of knowledge to throw down just yet. We also got more set up in our workroom. Meeting with Dr. Kakar on Wednesday was definitely valuable. He suggested that we meet up with Dillon Mark, who graduated last year and could be of some help, and John Schock, a BIOS engineer at Intel and alumnus of PLU. Josh has started posting on the Raspberry Pi forums, looking for advice, and I am trying to track down an email for Mr. Schock that is not linked with his LinkedIn account, considering I don't know how reliable that is to contact him. If by Saturday I can't find one, I'll shoot him a message over LinkedIn and see if he can be of help. We are also still planning on contacting Raspberry Pi directly and seeing if we can talk to someone there. Some issues we haven't worked out yet, there's no CMOS (I'm pretty sure it's CMOS) on the Pi itself, which means that the hardware must somehow already be configured to look at the SD card for all the necessary boot information before the BIOS loads up. We are currently looking into how that works.\r\n\r\nJosh and Dan are both working hard, and with Dr. Kakar's help, I think we have a legitimate chance of pulling this off. After next week my schedule will open up considerably, and we will have a good amount of time in the mornings to work on capstone in our workroom. On Saturday, Dan and I are meeting up on Saturday and Josh will telecommute via Skype, so we can work more on our Requirements Doc. I plan on reading as much as I can about the ARM 11 until then (and during) and researching as much as I can about the exact process a computer goes through during BIOS. Our plan is to get a rough draft to Dr. Kakar by Thursday for him to look over, then revise, revise, revise until we have to turn it in. Cheers!\r\n## 10/4/2012\r\nOur group has set up regular meeting times, and we have our meetings with Prof. Kakar planned out. We are still working on our requirements document, and have hashed out a lot of potential problems with our project. We are still gathering resources at this point, but we are getting some literature going, as well as web articles. Since Raspberry Pi as a company is focused on education, we plan on attempting to make contact with them and see if we can correspond with someone, either short term or (preferably) long term.\r\n\r\nAs a team, I think we are working well. We just recently got our schedules together to coordinate meeting times more efficiently, and encountered an age-old problem: It's hard to meet up when we all have different schedules. Currently, I have the hardest time fitting things in to our meeting times. As a result, I feel as if I am not doing my share of work, but am still focused on email correspondence and meeting up whenever possible. After mid-semester break, I will have much more free time, and our group should hopefully be able to meet more easily.\r\n\r\nBoth Dan and Josh are working diligently. Josh lives pretty far away from school, so it's also hard meeting with him, but he is doing a great amount of research for us and has found some really helpful sources. Given his previous experience with lower-level programming, he is finding things I personally hadn't even considered looking for. Dan is also working hard; he and I meet up fairly regularly because we share another course. Dan's knowledge of circuits has come in handy in looking up the hardware configurations for the Raspberry Pi, and we've been able to make some pretty surprising discoveries because of it. Cheers!\r\n## 9/25/2012\r\nThis is my first blog post! Not much to report, but we are starting some good preliminary research and are making some headway toward our requirements document. So far scheduling times for all three of us to meet has been difficult, but doable.
