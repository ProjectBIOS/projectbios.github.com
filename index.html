        <h1>Welcome to ProjectBIOS</h1>

<p>This website will track our progress throughout the process of building and designing a BIOS system for the Raspberry Pi. Our team consists of three members, and is a student project at PLU for our capstone class. Our faculty mentor is Dr. Kakar.</p>

<h2>Our Plan</h2>

<p>Our plan is to design and implement a Basic Input Output System (BIOS) tailor-made for the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi uses an ARM processor, so we are still working on if our plan can be implemented as is. If not, we may have to switch to another small system. We are still in the preliminary stages of our research and conceivably will not know for certain if it can be done until we attempt it. For now, we are gung-ho and are excited to try something new and different!</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p>The potential benefits of this project are many. The first of which is that is is different from the typical project at PLU. Many projects are solely based in high-level coding and design, whereas our project aims to reach through to the lowest levels of abstraction. This experience with low-level coding is a major advantage in the workplace, because it helps us understand and interpret what goes on at a higher level. This understanding gives us an edge when running into problems of design or implementation. We will better understand how software and hardware communicate, potentially revealing previously unseen ways to better our code.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<p>Our time line is obviously tentative, as is the hallmark of software development. However, we plan on meeting the following dates with these goals in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>September: We have been hard at work conducting research and planning</li>
<li>October:   We plan on having our requirements document finalized</li>
<li>November:  Our plan is to have completed at least preliminary function testing on the Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>December:  Our project plan should be finished and we should be starting implementation</li>
<li>January:   We hope to have implemented our BIOS POST (Power On Self-Test)</li>
<li>February:  Implement hardware configuration</li>
<li>March:     Nail down boot-strapping</li>
<li>April:     Complete development and testing of our BIOS</li>
<li>May:       Present our project</li>
</ul>
